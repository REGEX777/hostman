Project Setup Guide (aka How to Get Stuff Running)
Hey there! Ready to get your project up and running on a Linux box? Sweet! Let’s get you sorted with Node.js, Nginx, and all that stuff.
What You’ll Need
Before you start, make sure that you’ve:
A Linux OS (like Ubuntu, Debiano)
Terminal access
Getting Started
Step 1: System Update & Upgrade
Firstly we will make sure that your system is up to date. Run this command:
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
Grab a coffee while it does its thing.
Step 2: Install Node.js & npm
You’re gonna need Node.js (version 21, the LTE version) and npm.
Install NVM
First, let’s get NVM installed:
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.3/install.sh | bash
Once that’s done, reload your shell:
source ~/.bashrc
Install Node.js (v21.x)
Now that you’ve got NVM, let’s install Node.js version 21:
nvm install 21
nvm use 21
Check if it’s working:
node -v
npm -v
You're good if you see something like 21.XX
Step 3: Clone That Repo
Time to grab your project from GitHub (or wherever it’s hiding):
git clone https://github.com/REGEX777/hostman.git
cd hostman
Step 4: Install Project Dependencies
Now that you’re in the project folder, let’s install the necessary Node.js packages:
npm install
