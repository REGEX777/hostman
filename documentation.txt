Project Setup Guide (aka How to Get Stuff Running)
Hey there! Ready to get your project up and running on a Linux box? Sweet! Let’s get you sorted with Node.js, Nginx, and all that stuff.
Open up the default Nginx config file:
sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/default
Paste this in (add your domain):
codeserver {
    listen 80;
    server_name urdomain.com www.urdomain.com;
​
    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:7999;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
    }
}
Save it (CTRL + X, then Y, then Enter) and test the config:
sudo nginx -t
If all’s good, restart Nginx:
sudo systemctl restart nginx
PM2 Installation
Let's install PM2 which is pretty handy for our usecase:
npm install pm2 -g
Step 7: Start Your App
pm2 start npm --name "yourappname" -- start
Swap out "yourappname" with whatever you wanna call your app. (ex: imagehostapp)
Step 8: Edit your internet.json file:
Go to the root directory of the cloned github repository and run the following command:
nano internet.json
You'll see something like this
{
    "domain": "http://yourdomain.com/"
}
Replace the http://yourdomain.com with your domain.
​
Step 9: Check your website out:
Your website should now be up and running on the configured domain!
