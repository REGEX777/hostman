Let's setup shareX which will be used to upload our screenshots to hostman.

Step 1: Installing ShareX
You can install the shareX setup from here. 

Step 2: Configure ShareX
Once your server is ready we will setup shareX to use it.

2.1 Open ShareX and Navigate to Custom Uploader Settings
Fire up ShareX.

Go to Destinations > Custom uploader settings...


2.2 Add a New Custom Uploader
Click the Add button to create a new custom uploader.

Name it whatever you like—something catchy like "MyUploader" works.

Make sure you enter file in the File form name


2.3 Configure the Upload Settings
Here’s where the magic happens:

Request Type: Set this to POST.

URL: This should be your upload endpoint. Something like http://yourdomain.com/api/yourapikey.

File Form Name: Set this to file. This matches the name used in our script.

2.4 Test the Configuration
Hit the Test button to make sure everything's working. If it is, you should see a URL returned that points to your uploaded file. If not, double-check your settings or check the logs on your server to see what's up.

Step 3: Upload and Celebrate!
With everything configured, you can now use ShareX to upload images directly to your server. Just take a screenshot or drag a file into ShareX, and it’ll be uploaded to your custom endpoint. The link will be copied to your clipboard, ready to share!

Troubleshooting
Uploads not working? Double-check your server logs for errors, and make sure the upload directory exists and is writable.

Conclusion
And that's it! You've set up a custom uploader for ShareX. Now you can host all your screenshots and files on your own server. High five!
